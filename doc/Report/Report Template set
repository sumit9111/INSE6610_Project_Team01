\begin{abstract}
\textbf{The term of IoT means Internets of Things, they are internet connected devices and networks that are used for the sole purpose of automation and monitoring tasks. Technology is growing rapidly and it has became an essential part of our daily life; everyone owns an IoT device that they use for communication which creates and transmit data. This huge amount of data can be  collected and used in a court of law, and this is done by a digital forensic investigators. In this paper, we take on DFRWS IoT Forensic Challenge 2018-2019 challenge and we use efficient approaches that are effectively used for cyber forensics investigations including cloud data, smart things hub, amazon echo devices and automation devices to tackle this challenge.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:introduction} This report summarizes the result and process of digital forensic analysis on evidences of DFRWS IoT forensic challenge (2018-2019) scenario.

The report is organized as follows: Chapter 1 presents a general overview of the challenge scenario. Chapter 2 presents the tools used for the forensic analysis and describe them. chapter 3 conduct the forensic analysis and investigate using the tools and the data provided by the Challenger. Chapter 4 summarises the paper and what we learned in the course of the challenge.


\subsection{Description of challenge}
\label{callengescenario} The following is given to us by dfrws:
On 17 May 2018 at 10:40, the police were alerted that an illegal drug lab was invaded and
unsuccessfully set on fire. The police respond promptly, and a forensic team is on scene at 10:45,
including a digital forensic specialist.
The owner the illegal drug lab, Jessie Pinkman, is nowhere to be found. Police interrogate two of
Jessie Pinkman’s known associates: D. Pandana and S. Varga. Pandana and Varga admit having
access to the drug lab’s Wi-Fi network but deny any involvement in the raid. They also say that Jessie
Pinkman’s had the IoT security systems installed because he feared attacks from a rival gang and
that Jessie kept the alarm engaged in “Home” mode whenever he was inside the drug lab.
Within the drug lab the digital forensic specialist observes some IoT devices, including an alarm
system (iSmartAlarm), three cameras (QBee Camera, Nest Camera and Arlo Pro) as well as a smoke
detector (Nest Protect). An Amazon Echo and a Wink Hub are also present.
The digital forensic specialist preserves the diagnostic logs from the iSmartAlarm base station, and
acquires a copy of the file system of the Wink Hub. He also collects the iSmartAlarm and Arlo base
stations to perform an in-depth analysis at the forensic laboratory.
The digital forensic specialist also notices that the a QBee Camera seems to be disabled, so he
collects a sample of the network traffic.
Back at the forensic laboratory, the digital forensic specialist uses the bootloader to collect a memory
image of the two base stations as well as an archive of some folder of interest of the Arlo base station.
Jessie Pinkman's Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge is found at the scene, likely dropped during the raid.
The digital forensic specialist acquires a physical image of this Samsung device.

\subsection{Challenge Questions}
The Attorney General needs answers to the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item At what time was the illegal drug lab raided?
\item Could any of the two friends of Jessie Pinkman have been involved in the raid?
\item If yes: Which friend?
\item What is the confidence in such hypothesis?
\item How was the QBee camera disabled?
\end{itemize}

\section{Forensic Tools}

\label{FA}In this section we will list and describe the tools used to resolve the challenge.


\subsection{Autopsy} Autopsy is a platform for digital forensics and a graphical interface to The Sleuth Kit and other digital forensics instruments. The law enforcement, military, and corporate examiners use it to determine what has happened on a computer. You can even use this free, fast, easy to use application which is able to analyze all types of mobile devices and digital media \cite{pari_1},\cite{pari_2}
