In order to protect user credentials, the application uses the Secure Preferences library to enhance the confidentiality of the storage with the Shared Preferences format. But because of the customization of the library, the data used for encryption can be obtained from the application source. This can be confirmed directly by decompiling the APK by the tools that weâ€™ve mentioned in \ref{fig:Qbee Application APK File}, Figure \ref{fig:Decompile APK with Ghidra and String Search Feature Looking for Password and References} and Figure \ref{fig:Decompile APK with Jadx and String Search Feature Looking for Password and References}.
QBee cameras are known to have several vulnerabilities.
