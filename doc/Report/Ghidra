Ghidra is a software reverse engineering (SRE) framework created and maintained by the National Security Agency Research Directorate. This framework includes a suite of full-featured, high-end software analysis tools that enable users to analyze compiled code on a variety of platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Capabilities include disassembly, assembly, decompilation, graphing, and scripting, along with hundreds of other features. Ghidra supports a wide variety of processor instruction sets and executable formats and can be run in both user-interactive and automated modes. Users may also develop their own Ghidra plug-in components and/or scripts using Java or Python .
Ghidra supports headless mode, enabling researchers to spin up any number of cloud instances and reverse engineer at scale. Something that would be both technically difficult and very expensive to do in other tools such as IDA Pro. Ghidra can also be deployed in headless mode as a server to enable group collaboration when reverse engineering large binaries .
