\subsection{DB Browser for SQLite}
DB Browser for SQLite (DB4S) is a high quality, visual, open source tool to create, design, and edit database files compatible with SQLite. In our case, we used this tool to brows the different databases found in Jessie Pinkman's phone,  Table \ref{tab:DB} is the list of the databases found there. Immense amount of data about Jessie was found, most of them were unrelated to the event but some of them lead us to important evidence that can be used in the case and to track Jessie such as his Amazon account ID, which was found in Amazon databases.
