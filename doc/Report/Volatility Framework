\subsection{Volatility}
Volatility Framework is an open source framework implemented in Python under the GNU, for Random Access Memory (RAM) analysis for 32bit and 64bit Windows, Linux, Mac and Android systems The extraction techniques are performed completely independent of the system being investigated but offer visibility into the runtime state of the system \cite{Ab_4}\cite{Ab_5}. Volatility is a single, cohesive framework analyzes RAM dumps from 32- and 64-bit windows, linux, mac, and android systems. It’s Open Source GPLv2, which means you can read it, learn from it, and extend it. it's unparalleled feature sets based on reverse engineering and specialized research. It's comprehensive coverage of file formats – volatility can analyze raw dumps, crash dumps, hibernation files, VMware .vmem, VMware saved state and suspended files (.vmss/.vmsn), VirtualBox core dumps, LiME (Linux Memory Extractor), expert witness (EWF), and direct physical memory over Firewire. Finally and most importantly to our use it is Forensics/IR/malware focus – Volatility was designed by forensics, incident response, and malware experts to focus on the types of tasks these analysts typically form. \\ We used it to analyze Arlo Camera data set that consisted of memory dump image fileNVRAM settings and the TAR archive of the folder /tmp/media/nand.
