\subsection{Wireshark}
Wireshark is a tool used in digital forensic to capture network traffic and analyze network traffic. These captured network packets are pcap files that when inserted into Wireshark, it is parsed according to traffic packets, packet header information and payload information. Packets captured using Wireshark are saved in .pcap formats ad given for this project.\\
In many cases, Wireshark is also called a packet sniffer. Consider Wireshark as a mail person who takes packages from clients and can scan each package and determines the nature, shape, words, texture of all contents in the packages. Wireshark is dependent on the principles of network connectivity which is the OSI model. The data available for this investigation is the dfrws\_police.pcap. Using Wireshark, I will take note of the nature of the packets captured over the network which includes the size of packets transmitted (Tx) and Received (Rx) and the time the packets were sent.
